5 basic components of LC path
    Global Bus
    Memory
    ALU and register file
    PC and PCMUX
    MARMUX


Bus is shared, must be multiplexed because multiple components are using it
    Good because 1 wire works for multiple
    16 bits in one wire
Point-to-point interconnect is one to one and doen't need to be multiplexed
Tristate device
    Switch for on/off
    Allow only one supplier for bus
    When component doesn't need, it essentially disconnects
    Most components that use BUS need
Memory
    Read to MAR
    Read/Write To/From MDR
    Tristate GateMDR
        Tells when to write read or do nothing

ALU and Reg File
    ALU Sources
        Register or SEXT
        Controlled by IR[5]
    Condition codes
        Comparator logic, results of ALU
    
    Signals from FSM

PC and PC MUX
    FETCH stage: Add 1 to PC and use prev PC to find next instruction and write it to next register
    PC MUX helps chose whether it is +1 or +SEXT depending on branching

Instruction cycle
    Fetch (load IR)
    Decode
    Evaluate address
    operand Fetch
    Execute (not required)
    Store result
