High level languages
    Java, C++, C
Low level language
    Assembly
    ISA dependant (machine)
    mnemonics for opcode (0001)--> ADD

lines with ; are comments
Instructions tell computer what to do

**Instruction**:
    Label Opcode Operands ;comment
    Again Add R1,R2,R3    ; Adding R2 and R3 to R1

**Labels**
Symbols to identify memory location
1 to 20 alphanumeric chars
    start with a letter
    Except seq that cause ambiguity
Reasons
    Target of a branch
    Location that has a value in memory
Essentially allows code to jump to a different part

**Psuedo Ops**
Helps assembler translate memory to ISA

*.orig*: Where the program starts the program (.orig x3050 means first address is at x3050)
NOTE: This does not mean the start of the program is right below the .orig
REQUIRED
*.fill*: Initialize memory to a number/label
SIX .FILL x0006
Essentilly makes a var
Mem[SIX] = Mem[0x3058] == 0x006
*.BLKW*: sets a side block(s) of memory
NUMBER .BLWK 2
reserves 2 spaces for NUMBER
Used for arrays and such
Next instruction is 2 blocks away
*.stringz*
Initialize n+1 memory locations with 0 extended ascii code of characters in the input string
![Alt text](image-8.png)
Each ascii is a different 
String closed with null char (0x0000)
*.end* is the end of the program (different from HALT)
doesn't translate to machine code
Tells assembler no other instruction


**ADD**
ADD DR, SR1, SR2
ADD SR, SR1, imm5
Adds depending on bit 5
and then sets condition code

**AND**
Same thing as above

**BR**
nzp: last instruction was negative, zero, or positive respectfully
Jumps to offset if condition is true
BRnp LOOP
    If last instruction was negative or positive, adds LOOP to PC and goes to it
Limited to -256 to 255
Remember: PC is at 1+current address
to loops the instruction offset is -1

**JMP AND RET** (Jump and return from subroutine)
PC counter becomes some address
Return always uses R7, JMP uses the specified address
JMP R1
RET
Jump to address stored in register 1, returns to whatever is stored in R7
