***Embedded Systems: communication between different parts of computer for a specific purpose***
        *aka cyber-physical, Internet of Things, real-time systems*

Cyber-Physical systems: Computer + Physical system **NEEDS CORRECT VALUE AT RIGHT TIME**
1. Performance: need to be fast
2. Efficency: need to be not too hot/expensive
3. Safety: need to work
4. Security and Privacy: need to be safe

Correct Value at wrong time is a fault
Embedded systems are NOT end-user programmable
