Stores into IR
Decodes it and the sends signals to other component

*Multiplexer*
Takes in multiple inputs and has one output

**instruction**
Instructions are sequence of bits with 2 pieces of information
    Smallest unit of 
    Opcode: operation (+, !, >=)
    Operands: data to be used
LC-3 has 15 instructions
    opcode: 4 bits needed
    operands: 12 bits left
    Also 6 data movement instructions
Add instruction
    3 operands: 2 numbers that will be added and 1 destinatin (sum)
    >= 1 operands are from register and result stored in register
    Ex: ADD R3, R1, R2 is R3 = R1 + R2
    2 source registers are used to get information and then a destination register is used to store the result
    If bit number 5 is 0 then ADD elif 1 then ADDi (Add but 1 var and 1 immediate value)
