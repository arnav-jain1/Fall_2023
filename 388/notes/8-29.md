> **8 bits = 1 byte** \
> 8 bits is 8 0s in binary or 2 letters in hex

## Data types
    1. integer: int, char
       - Int is 16 bits or 2 bytes
       - Char is 8 bits or 1 byte
    2. Floating point: float, double
    3. Void: FUnction return type and universal pointer types
    4. Derived types: Pointers and arrays
## Modifiers
    1. Short: half bits
    2. Long: Double the bits
    3. Signed: Normal
    4. Unsigned: Only positive
## Type Qualifier
    1. Const: Value of var can't be modified
    2. Volatile: Re-load register from memory every access 
        Important because embedded systems can change value of variable without the processor knowing so any var linked to an embedded system should be 
## Conversion hex/decimal/binary 
Hex to binary, each number is 4 binary digits \
hex to decimal \
2s complement is used for signed integers, the first digit is negative and the rest are positive. If the first digit is 1 then it is negative

## Float and double
**Float**: 6 significant decimal bits of precision \
**Double**: 15-17 significant bits of precision
