_8 bits = 1 byte_
**Data types**
    1. integer: int, char
    2. Floating point: float, double
    3. Void: FUnction return type and universal pointer types
    4. Derived types: Pointers and arrays
*Modifiers*
    1. Short: half bits
    2. Long: Double the bits
    3. Signed: Normal
    4. Unsigned: Only positive
*Type Qualifier*
    1. Const: Value of var can't be modified
    2. Volatile: Re-load register from memory every access 
        Important because embedded systems can change value of variable without the processor knowing so any var linked to an embedded system should be 
        Volatile
*Conversion hex/decimal/binary*
Hex to binary, each number is 4 binary digits
hex to decimal 
2s complement is used for signed integers, the first digit is negative and the rest are positive. If the first digit is 1 then it is negative
