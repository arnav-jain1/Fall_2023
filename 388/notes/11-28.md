# Lec 18 Scheduling
## Rate Monotonic
* Fixed-priority scheduling algorithim
* Shorter period is higher priority
    * Shorter period is always picked even if a deadline is rapidly approaching

## Earliest deadline first
* The earlier the deadline the higher the priority
* Earliest deadline is chosen to be done


## RM preferred over EDR
* RM is easier to implement 
    * Period is always constant and deadline never changes so priority never changes
* RM more transparrent and robust
* Easy to understand if something goes wrong
* RM Might not get 100% Utilization though 
* RM best for fixed-priority policy
* EDF good for dynamic scheduling policy
