**Instruction Set Register** 
Memory organization
    16 bit addressability
    2^16 address space
General purpose register
    8 of them and 16 bits each 
    Accessed in 1 clock cycle
    Does math and stores info
Availible Instruction
    Defined by OPcode, data type, and addressing mode
    15 opcodes, 1 reserved in LC3, 19 total instructions (some share)
    2s complement
    *5 modes*
        Immediate
        Register
        PC Relative (memory)
        Indirect (memory)
        Base + offset

**Operations**
Only add, and, and not
*Immediates* 
    Dont get value from register, they use the given value
    R3 = R2 + 5
    Bit 5 declares immediate or not
*Subt*
To do R3 = R2 - R1
    Not R2 to get 2s complement
    Add 1 to R2 so that R2 is now negative original number
    Do R3 = R2 + R1 
*Load effective address*
Load DR Register with PC (Program counter or current instruction) then signed extention (9 bit)
**Data Movement Instruction**
Moves data between reigster, memory, and IO devices
Load: Memory to register
Store: Register to memory
OPcode, sourse, and destination needed
*PC Relative mode*
LD and ST
Address = PC + SEXT(bits[0-8])
Limited range ([255-256]) of PC
*Indirect Mode*
LDI and STI
Address = Mem{PC+Mem[SEXT(bits[0-8])]}
Address not limited because Memory at sext can be anything
*Base + Offset*
LDR and STR
Address = SEXT(bits[0-5]) + Reg#
**Control**
Alter sequence of instructions
*Conditional Branch* (BR)
OPcode 0000
Tells whether to get instruction from Mem[PC + SEXT] or from PC
Control codes are n, z, p, at 11-9 respectively
![If last instruction is 0, jump x0D9 spaces](image-4.png)
[-256-255]
*Unconditional Branch (Jump)*
Unconditional jump
Execute next instruction from Mem[Register base]
![If R2 = x00A1, next instruction will be from x00A1](image-5.png)
**Trap instruction**
Invokes OS call
Bits[0-7] identify which service call
Once done, PC looks at the next instruction
    Ex: Read char from keyboard, write char to screen
