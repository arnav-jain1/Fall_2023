**JMP** Jump
Ret: implicitly uses R7 so don't change R7
**JSR/R** Jump to subroutine
Change in bit 11 specifies whether JSRR or JSR
Stores next address in R7 to be used by RET

JSRR jumps to the address specified in the given register while JSR adds given offset to PC
Returns to RET after subroutine is done

*JSR/R Jumps and implicitly changes R7 while Jump doesn't store PC into R7 automatically*
Used for functions and stuff
You can get into an infinite loop because RET will keep going back to R7
To stop the loop put the subroutine after the halt

**LD** Load
Label is a number
Destination Register = Mem[PC + Sext(Label)]
Between -256 and 255

**LDI** Load Indirect address
DR = Mem[Mem[PC + SEXT(offset)]]
You get the address at the memory address of PC+offset

**LDR** Load Register
DR = Mem[BaseR + SEXT(offset6)]
You add register to offset

**LEA**
DR = PC + SEXT(offset)


***ST*** IS SAME AS LOAD BUT STORING INSTEAD OF GETTING VALUE
**ST** Store (Changing value at address)
SR = Mem[PC + Sext(Label)]

**STI** 
SR = Mem[Mem[PC + SEXT(offset)]]

**STR**
SR = Mem[Base Register + Offset]

**TRAP** System call
location 0000 to 00FF (trap table)
