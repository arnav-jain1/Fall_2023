# Lec 8 Assembly Instructions
## Jump instructions
**JMP** Jump \
Ret: implicitly uses R7 so don't change R7 \
**JSR/R** Jump to subroutine \
Change in bit 11 specifies whether JSRR or JSR \
Stores next address in R7 to be used by RET 

JSRR jumps to the address specified in the given register while JSR adds given offset to PC \
Returns to RET after subroutine is done \

*JSR/R Jumps and implicitly changes R7 while Jump doesn't store PC into R7 automatically* \
Used for functions and stuff \
You can get into an infinite loop because RET will keep going back to R7 \
To stop the loop put the subroutine after the halt

## Load
**LD** Load \
Label is a number \
Destination Register = Mem[PC + Sext(Label)] \
Between -256 and 255 of PC 

**LDI** Load Indirect address \
DR = Mem[Mem[PC + SEXT(offset)]] \
You get the address at the memory address of PC+offset \
Essentially whatever is at PC + Offset is a pointer to the actual value

**LDR** Load Register \
DR = Mem[BaseR + SEXT(offset6)] \
You add register to offset \
Essentially just getting the value that is at: specific register + SEXT(offset6)

**LEA** \
DR = PC + SEXT(offset) \
No Memory access

## Store
***ST IS SAME AS LOAD BUT STORING INSTEAD OF GETTING VALUE*** \
**ST** Store (Changing value at address) \
SR = Mem[PC + Sext(Label)] 

**STI**  \
SR = Mem[Mem[PC + SEXT(offset)]] \
Whatever is at PC + Offset is a pointer to the actual value

**STR** \
SR = Mem[Base Register + Offset] 

## Trap
**TRAP** System call
location 0000 to 00FF (trap table)


# Other notes for Midterm 
Addressibility =/= more space

Addressability: The number of bits that a machine can address at its smallest data unit, often a byte or word.
Address Space: The total amount of memory locations that can be addressed by a computer system, determined by the number of bits in its addressing scheme.
