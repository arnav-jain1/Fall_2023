Pointer stores address of memory, declared and derefrenced by *

int *ptr; pointer var declared
int var = 10;
ptr = &var; Pointer points to where 10 is located
*ptr = 20; The value at the address is now 20
**VAR IS NOW 20**
& is address of and thats how you assign a pointer

You pass functions through using pointers

processing unit: ALU
control unit: Made of program counter and Instruction register
    Instruction register: Current instruction being executed
    Program counter: Address of next few instruction to be executed
