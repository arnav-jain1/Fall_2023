Pointer stores address of memory, declared and derefrenced by *

int *ptr; pointer var declared \
int var = 10; \
ptr = &var; Pointer points to where 10 is located \ 
*ptr = 20; The value at the address is now 20 \
**VAR IS NOW 20** \
& is address of and thats how you assign a pointer

You pass functions through using pointers
