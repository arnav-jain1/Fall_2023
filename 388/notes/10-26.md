**General purpose IO (GPIO)**

Programmable digital input/output
Voltage to represent digital signals
    3.3V for 1
    0.0V for 0
Useful to interact with devices

Ohms Law: I * R = V

**Serial vs Parallel interface**
Serial uses a single line that sends a stream of info
Parallel uses multiple lines that all simultaneously send info

Serial interfaces
    - Fewer pins and wires
    - More scalability
    - Lower power
    - low bandwidth (bad)
    - Ex
      - USB 
      - Sata
Parallel interfaces
    - More pins and wires
    - Less scalability due to synchronizing lanes
    - Higher power consumption
    - more bandwidth (good)
    - Ex
      - PCIe
      - DDR
    
**Transfer types**
Simple 1 to 1
Half duplex: 2 to 2 through one lane
Full duplex: 2 to 2 through 2 seperate lanes
