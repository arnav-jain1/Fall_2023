**I2C**
Inter-integrated Circuit protocol
2 Wires used
    SDA for data
    SCL for clock
Standard speed is 100Kbps
Ultra fast speed is 5MBps (50x faster)
Serial synchronous bus
7 or 10 bits for slave address: 128 ~ 1024 devices 
Bus interconnect

Start condition: When SCL is high, SDA high to low
Stop condition: When SCL is high, SDA low to high

The master controls the bus because the slave cant write without the master's permission
ACK/NACK
    If read the master sets the ack/nack but if writing the slave sets the ack nack
    Whoever is getting the info sets the ack nack
    The first ack/nack is set by the slave because the slave has to receive the read/write instruction
8 bit granularity
Every data frame is 8 bit but you can send as many as you want (along with ACK/NACK bit) until the master says no more

**SPI** Serial periphrial Interface
Synchronous serial communication protocol
4 lines full duplex, over 10 Mbps
1 master but many slaves
No start stop bit
Fast short distance communication


SCLK is the serial clock which the master sets to control communication
SS is the slave select which selects which slave to use

Master shifts out to MOSI (Master out slave in)
Slave shifts in from MISO (Master in slave out)
Slave shifts in from MOSI and out to MISO


**USB**
Point to point serial communication
Two wires for single differential signal

No changes in signal means 1, 0 when there is a change in signal
This is done so that USB can handle noise due to electromagnetic interference allowing for longer communication.


**IO Considerations**
Serial vs parallel
wired vs wireless
Speed
Real-time/QoS guarentees
Power/Electrical requirements
Reliability
