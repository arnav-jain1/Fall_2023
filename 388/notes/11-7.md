# Lec 15 IO Devices ADC DAC
## ADC DAC

> **ADC**: Analog to digital converter \
**DAC**: Digital to analog converter \
Digital inputs converted to current \
The current provided by Iout is a function of input binary numbers and the reference current

## Operational Amplifier (OpAmp)
Amplify electrical signals \
2 inputs
- Inverting input (-) 
- non inverting input (+) 

Negative feedback: Output fed back to inverting input in order to stabalize \
High impedance at input and low impedance at output \
OpAmp equalizes by making the - the same as the + by lowering the output voltage \
EX:     If 1 is the input, then the - will also be 1 and the output would be 2 (I think chatGPT says otherwise)

## IO Considerations
Serial vs parallel
wired vs wireless
Speed
Real-time/QoS guarentees
Power/Electrical requirements
Reliability
