# Lec 9 OS
## Trap (System Call)
Tells the OS to do something like HALT
## OS
Give users resources while stopping the user from harming the memory or programs
### Privilige
Right to do something \
Also used to prevent user from accessing needed memory \
Ex: Don't want users to call HALT or alter memory that's required for running
* Program in supervisor mode is privileged 
  * Can access all instructions and memory address
  * sudo
* Program in user mode is unprivileged
  * Can't execute privileged instructions or access privileged memory addresses
### Priority
Urgency to do something compared to other programs
Unrelated to each other

Ex: \
    Info from sensor: no priv but high priority \
    Info from keyboard: priv but low priority

### Processor status register
Each program has two registers, PC and PSR as well as NZP condition codes
![Alt text](image-6.png) \
Exists in IO Page

### Memory Space
    Made up of:
    System Space            Priv 
    supervisor stack        Priv
    User space              User
    User Stack              User
    I/O page                Priv
    IO Page is also where memory mapped Registers and IO is at
**Stack**
* Temporary space for Functions
* Grows and shrinks dynamically
    * Call a function and it grows, remove a function and it increases
    * Grows until reaches a max specified by the operating system


# Lec 10 Subroutine
## Subroutine
Essentially just a function \
Call by using JSR or JSRR and then return by using RET (or JMP R7)

Writing to register means losing previous value \
We need to save the registers elsewhere (in memory using ST) 

**JMP**
Jumps to a different address 
Does NOT store the PC into R7

**JSR**
Same thing as JMP but stores PC into R7 for it to be used by RET

**JSRR**
Same thing at JSR but instead of jumping to a LABEL it jumps to an address stored by a register
