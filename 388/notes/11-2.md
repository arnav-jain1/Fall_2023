**Synchronous vs Asych**
Synch:
    Common shared clock
    High throughput
    Low scalibility

Asynch: 
    No shared clock
    Asynch start/stop
    Self-clocked, based on agreement between transmitter and receiver 

**Serial communication standard** RS-232

Asynch because no clock signal

Introduced in 1962 to connect teletypes to modems 
Electrical signals and teletypes standard
1 represented by -3 to -15V
0 represented by +3 to +15V

Essentially, it is a stream of bits starting from a start bit all the way to 2 end bits with an optional parity bit
Ex:
    1 101110100 1 11
    The first bit is a start bit 
    The 101110100 is the data
    1 is the parity bit (used to check for data correction by checking if the number of ones is odd or even, 1 if odd 0 if even so amount of bits should always be even)
    11 is the stop bit
The data is scrambled (the first bit might be the LSB) so flip it

goodput is used bits in data /12
12 bits is transferred in one frame 

**UART** (uses RX 232)
Convert parallel content of 8-bit register to a bit sequence ready to be transferred over a serial port
Both sender and receiver have to have agreed upon transmission
Check if TX FIFO is not full, if it isn't full, send a byte
4 bits of overhead when sending info 
So to send 8 bits you will actually send 12
**Types of Network**
Point to point: 1:1 communication
    Faster when direct
    More scalable
Bus: shared, needs arbitration
    More effeceint but slower
    Master: Starts transfer
    Slave: Cooperates with master



***ADC & DAC***

ADC: Analog to digital converter
**DAC**: Digital to analog converter
Digital inputs converted to current
The current provided by Iout is a function of input binary numbers and the reference current


Operational Amplifier (OpAmp)
Amplify electrical signals
2 inputs: Inverting input (-) and non inverting input (+)
Negative feedback: Output fed back to inverting input in order to stabalize
High impedance at input and low impedance at output 
OpAmp equalizes by making the - the same as the + by lowering the output voltage
EX:     If 1 is the input, then the - will also be 1 and the output would be 2
