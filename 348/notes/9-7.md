**Modeling**
Used to simplify reality
Help us visualize and specify structure/behaivior
Document decisions
Modeling is used to communicate and reason easier and consistently
try to make the model natural, elegant, simple (sometimes many needed)
Start simpler and become more and more complex as you go.
ONLY created when useful


**UML** Unified modeling language
visual language for specification 
Can be mapped into other languages like Java
    *Static*: Show static structure like class, object, operations, relationships, etc
    *Dynamic*: Shows collaboration of objects and internal states (sequence and state transition diagrams)
__UML IS NOT A PROCESS IT IS A LANGUAGE__
Not complete but still powerful
