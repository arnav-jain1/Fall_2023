**Modeling**
Used to simplify reality
Help us visualize and specify structure/behaivior
Show classes, relationships, data, etc.
Document decisions
Modeling is used to communicate and reason easier and consistently
try to make the model natural, elegant, simple (sometimes many needed)

No single model is used, multiple models needed for different views and information (Different models of heart show different things)

**Static Model**: Static structure of system like classes, vars, relationships
**DYnamic model**: Dynamic behaivior of model by showing internal changes to the system (like sequence diagram and state machine)

*What are requirements?* Use case diagrams
*What is the structure?* Create class diagram4
*What behavior to expect?* Sequence or state diagram
*What installation?* Component diagram or deployment model

Start simpler and become more and more complex as you go.
ONLY created when useful


**UML** Unified modeling language
visual language for specification 
Can be mapped into other languages like Java
    *Static*: Show static structure like class, object, operations, relationships, etc
    *Dynamic*: Shows collaboration of objects and internal states (sequence and state transition diagrams)
__UML IS NOT A PROCESS IT IS A LANGUAGE__
Not complete but still powerful
