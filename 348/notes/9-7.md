**Modeling**
Used to simplify reality
Help us visualize and specify structure/behaivior
Show classes, relationships, data, etc.
Document decisions
Modeling is used to communicate and reason easier and consistently
try to make the model natural, elegant, simple (sometimes many needed)

No single model is used, multiple models needed for different views and information (Different models of heart show different things)

**Static Model**: Static structure of system like classes, vars, relationships
**DYnamic model**: Dynamic behaivior of model by showing internal changes to the system (like sequence diagram and state machine)

*What are requirements?* Use case diagrams
*What is the structure?* Create class diagram4
*What behavior to expect?* Sequence or state diagram
*What installation?* Component diagram or deployment model
