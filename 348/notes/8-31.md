**Compiled vs interpreted programs**
Compilation:
    Taking program in source language to target language (assembly) which is then turned into binary using assembler and linker
    Done via gcc/g++/clang/etc
    FAST but takes long to compile and code
    Platform dependant :(
Interpreted language:
    Source code is read and executed line by line
    Platform independant :)
    Easier to debug
    SLOWER
**Development process**
Process: set of activities planned and performed to achieve a given purpose
    Roles/Responsibilities
    Tools
    Procedures/methods
4 major broad activities
    Requirements engineering
        Analyzing and modeling the requirements
    Design
        Designing the archetiecture, Data structure, Component, interface
    Coding/Implementation
    Testing
Many development models (linear/waterfall, prototyping, incremental, spiral, agile)
Waterfall model
    Works well for problems with no changes in req
    Requirements--> Design-> Develop--> testing-->deploy--> Maintain (like painting from a sketch)
Incremental:
    Small functionality with more and more with each version (No Man's Sky)
Agile (scrum):
    Product owner: 
        Makes sure right features
    Scrum Master (project manager):
        Ensure project progresses
        Set up meetings
    You get feature requests and developers pick requests and implement it
    Backlog: collection of user requests
    Points given for each request depending on complexity
    Sprints: 2-30 day cycles to get more work done (essentially just crunch)
    Scrum reduces burn out
Unified Process
    Standard engineering process
    4 phases: 
        Inception: Vision, requirements
        elaboration: Software architecture
        construction: Initial operational program
        transition: Final release
