**Requirements engineering**
    Identify, document, and communicate purpose of new software
    Bridge between user needs and software capabilities
    establish functionalities (services) and constraints
    WHY needed and WHAT featurs
    3 factors of success: scope budget and schedule
    Requirements come from user
**Domain engineering**
    DOmain: area of natural or human activity (stocks, healthcare)
    Objective is to learn
    Captures concepts in problem and shows relationships between (like flow chart)
**Requirements elicitation**
    Communicate with stakeholders to get features
    Stakeholder-driven: stakeholders give knowledge
            Should identify important stakeholders
    Artifact-driven: documents give knowledge
    Requirements types: Functional, non-functional (quality), constraints
    Functional: 
        WHAT system dows
        "Features"
    Non-functional:
        Performance,
        stability
        security
    Constraints
        development process constraints like time and money
**requirements documentations**
    Details and documentation of new software
    definitions so that they are easy to understand
    Show process (like wanted features, struggles, constraints)
    Validation is the testing the quality of the product

***Good Requirements qualities***
    Completeness: Satisfies objectives
    Consistency: Compatibile with each other
    Unambiguity: Suffice different interpretations
    Traceability: Easy to retrieve information
    Feasibility: Must be doable
    Good structuring: Links among elements viewable
