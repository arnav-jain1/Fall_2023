Structured Programming is easier to understand than unstructured


**Functions**
Functions can have no params either by () or ( void )
Can overload (same function with different amounts of parameters)


**Function prototype** (Function declaration)
Tells the compiler
    Name of function
    Type of data returned   
    numbers, types, and order of parameters BUT NOT THE NAME OF PARAM
    Ex  int myFunc(int, int);

**Function signature**
Name of the function and type of its arguements
myFunc(int, int)
Functions can have same name but NOT signature

**Function header** 
Forward declaration and in header files
Full function except for body of the function
    Ex: int myFunc(int yes, int no);

**Storage classes**
Extern means global across all files it also says it is defined elsewhere
Static is global among the same file

**if else in one line**

(condition) ? if-true : else;
(a>b) ? a : b
if (a>b) then a else b


**scope**
Portion of code where var can be used
Block, func, global namespace, func prototype 

**Function call stack**
The first function that is called gets put into memory and when the function is done the block of memory is deallocated 

**Inline**
Tells the compiler to generate a copy of code every time the function is called
    This is useful because calls are very costly so this copies and pastes the binary values to do it without calling a function

**Params**
Pass by reference
    Passing the address where var is located and you can access and change the data directly
    Use &type to specify pass by reference
    To specify that the reference will stay constant, use the const keyword before the type in the params
    Const after function is saying that the function will not change the object being called
Pass by value
    Copy of the var created and passed
    CHanging the copy doesn't change the original var

**scope resolution operator**
If there is a global var and a local var with the same name, use ::var to specify the global var
Sometimes library:: is needed if it is being done from the same file

**Function overloading**
Several of same functions as long as they have different signatures
Create several functions with the same name that perform similar tasks but on different data types or amounts


**Function template**

template < typename T >
T max(T val1, T val2, T val3)
What this does is that it replaces T with typename and typename just means any var type (you can also specify a type)

**Type casting**
Types will be auto-convert (cast) from one type to another type
The types have to be compatabile 


**Classes**
Classes encapsulate:
    Set of data items and structures (data members)
    Set of operations (operation members)
        Aka functions, methods, services, behavior
    Can be private or public
Defines an abstract data type
Constructor is how to make the class object

*Access specifiers*
Public: Anyone can access (even the one using the class)
Private: Only member functions can access (the user cannot directly access)
Protected: Similar to Private

*constructor*
Initializes the class object (what to do when the object is made)
Cannot return anything
Same name as class
Member vars can be initialized by constructor either now or afterwards
*Destructor*
Deletes the class object (what to do when the object is deleted)
Cannot take arguements or overloaded 
denoted by ~

**Working with classes**
use object.method when working directly with the object
use object->method when working with a pointer to the object

To define a method you do
    Type Object::Funcname()
    int Time::getTime()

*Initalizing objects*
